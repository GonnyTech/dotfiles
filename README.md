These are my dotfiles. I personally run them on my daily used Linux laptop running Endeavour OS with Hyprland. They are a codewriting-oriented version of @RiccardoPP 's excellent dotfiles for Hyprland

# Main keybindings
Win+Return = Kitty
Win+S = New Java file in Sublime Text
Win+B = Firefox
Win+G = GitHub in Firefox
Win+C = Visual Studio Code
Win+T = New Text File in Sublime Text 
Win+E = Nemo

# Please note
Every keybinding was set to accomodate MY personal need. Since I use the laptop to write code at university using Java, I've set some keybindings to open some specific files in order to make my life as a code writer easier. However, any keybinding can be modified and adjusted to your specific need. All can be done in the hyprland.conf file.
