These are my dotfiles. I personally run them on my daily used Linux laptop running Endeavour OS with Hyprland. They are a codewriting-oriented version of @RiccardoPP 's excellent dotfiles for Hyprland.

The main keybindings are: 

Win+Return = Kitty
Win+S = New Java file in Sublime Text
Win+B = Firefox
Win+G = GitHub in Firefox
Win+C = Visual Studio Code
Win+T = New Text File in Sublime Text 
Win+E = Nemo
